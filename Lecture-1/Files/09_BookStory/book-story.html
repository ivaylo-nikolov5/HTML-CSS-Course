        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>
            Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, <br/> lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific <br/> journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy
            of <i>On The Road. It had</i> <br/> been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four <br/> walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

            She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar <br/> Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q>
